16:00:07.495 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
16:00:07.495       may result in fractions of threads. 
16:00:07.495       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
16:00:07.495       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
