21:13:17.851 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
21:13:17.851       may result in fractions of threads. 
21:13:17.851       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
21:13:17.851       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
