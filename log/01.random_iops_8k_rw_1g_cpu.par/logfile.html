08:04:56.248 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
08:04:56.248       may result in fractions of threads. 
08:04:56.248       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
08:04:56.248       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
