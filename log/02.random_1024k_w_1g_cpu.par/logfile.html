10:32:40.504 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
10:32:40.504       may result in fractions of threads. 
10:32:40.504       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
10:32:40.504       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
10:32:40.504       Contact the author of Vdbench if there are unexplained differences.
