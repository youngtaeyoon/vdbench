09:06:13.668 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
09:06:13.668       may result in fractions of threads. 
09:06:13.668       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
09:06:13.668       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
