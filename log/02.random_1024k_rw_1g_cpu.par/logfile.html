10:43:57.289 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
10:43:57.289       may result in fractions of threads. 
10:43:57.289       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
10:43:57.289       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
