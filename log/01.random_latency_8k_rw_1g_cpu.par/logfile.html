08:33:49.146 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
08:33:49.146       may result in fractions of threads. 
08:33:49.146       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
08:33:49.146       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
