22:57:21.324 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
22:57:21.324       may result in fractions of threads. 
22:57:21.324       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
22:57:21.324       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
