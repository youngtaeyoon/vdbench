09:58:21.330 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
09:58:21.330       may result in fractions of threads. 
09:58:21.330       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
09:58:21.330       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
