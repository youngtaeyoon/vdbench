17:32:07.832 Note: Requesting threads across multiple fsds, operations, slaves or hosts 
17:32:07.832       may result in fractions of threads. 
17:32:07.832       There will be a minimum of one thread for each fsd, operation, 
17:32:07.832       slave or host, or integer truncation of the resulting thread count.
